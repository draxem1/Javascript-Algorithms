#Min-Max
The min-max is a simple concept, it finds the lowest value and the highest value in an array. It doesn't just have to be implemented
with an array, it can be used with data structures. The reason it's considered an algorithm used for  __artificial intelligence__,
is because it is often used in two player games to create a hierchy of moves for the game player. Depending on the difficulty, the 
game will compute all possible moves and take the most effective one. This link [Min-Max](http://www.neverstopbuilding.com/minimax)
goes into detail, on how the min-max is implemented in a game of __"Tic Tac Toe"__.

###Why use it
    -Uses less code then brute force methods.
    -Calculates all positions or moves efficiently.
    -Can create life like game intelligence.
###Why not to use it
    -Can be hard to implement.
    -Not every game needs it.
    -Some algorithms may perform better, depending on it's implementation

##Test it out, and enjoy!
