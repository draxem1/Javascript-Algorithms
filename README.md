#Alorithms
If you program, you create algorithms! Since, Javascript is the most popular coding language in the world, and everyone is trying
to squeeze as much performance out of The browser. Algorithms, should be studied daily! If you read about the programmers that compete
in coding competitions, the top programmers say they solved the hard problems by having knowledge of algorithms. Game programmers, inorder to create the __A.I__, Artificial Inteligence, use algorithms. Some algorithms perform better than others, and some are better for storing data. A lot of these used to be mostly implemented with object-oriented languages such as c++ or Java. Whoever thought Javascript can't be object-oriented, beats me, but thats a topic for another time. My point is, that having knowledge, and knowing how to implement them in Javascript may be useful to you. It may even make you a better programmer. So learn some common algorithms, or at least check it out.

##How To Run 
Alright, so I used [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) text editor, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run Javascript. So if you have Sublime and Node you can create a build system in Sublime that will run your Javascript in a console. 
#####Step 1
Open Sublime & go to __"Tools > Build System > New Build System"__
#####Step 2
Paste this code in the new opened tab
```javascript
{
"cmd": ["/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Resources/jsc", "$file"],
"selector": "source.js"
}
```
#####Step 3
Save as __JSC.sublime-build__ in the default folder
#####Finally
Once, you have completed some Javascript. You can hit __CTRL B__ to build the Javascript and display the output to the console.
##Errors
If you see errors in the code or something I did wrong. After all I'am human. Please feel free to let me know. If you would like to add to it, go ahead clone it and commit the changes.
#Enjoy!!!!
