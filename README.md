  This is a collection of algorithms written in Javascript. By seeing the algorithms in code, instead of theory and on paper.
It's easier to learn and implement them in programs. For example, I made the "Tic Tac Toe" game in javascript. It doesn't seem
complicated until you get to the AI of the game. I had understanding of the Min-Max algorithm, but I did not know how to program
it. So I ended up using brute force. Alot of if statements!!! Once I saw the Min-Max in code it was like a light bulb turned on.

It's a work in progress, but will eventually be very usefull.
